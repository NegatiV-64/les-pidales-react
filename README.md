# Les Pidales React

This is one of my practice projects, build with React. The name of the food chain company is totally fictional, and please, do not sue with me.

## What is it?
It is a food order app, build with React, where you can order some fast food and then "order" it. I also wired up Telegram bot and the orders are going to the Telegram bot. As for the menu, I am fetching the data from the local json file and display it.

## What I used?

Obviously I used React to build this project. As a boilerplate, I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), since it is simple and fast to start the coding. 

Regarding the React in particular, I used:
* Fuctional Components 
* React Hooks
* Context API
* CSS Modules

And in addition, I have read Telegram bot API to wire up the bot.
